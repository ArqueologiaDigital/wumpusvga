# wumpusVGA
A version of the classic Hunt the Wumpus for VGA PC-Compatibles running DOS made in 2018, for some great anachronism

Mainly used the help of this book to understand how the VGA systems worked, really recommend it https://archive.org/details/BlackArt3DEBook

The game is still a bit broken in areas but it is playable.

I built and edited it using Borland's Turbo C++, so I dont really know if it works using any other compilers, I suppose Microsoft's C/C++ should work fine too.
